Hi there! I'm a master's student at Stanford, studying computer science and machine learning. I'm supervised by [Elisa Kreiss](https://www.coalas-lab.com/elisakreiss) and [Christopher Potts](https://web.stanford.edu/~cgpotts/papers.html). I'm interning at [Contextual AI](https://contextual.ai/) this summer, supervised by [Douwe Kiela](https://douwekiela.github.io/). My research interests are in the intersection of vision and language models.

I'm also a published fiction and poetry writer.

"'When I Grow Up I Want to Be a Fossil' is a wonderfully voice-driven short story with an inventive premise and deep love of human life and the natural world. Set against the blazing effects of climate change, “When I Grow Up I Want to Be a Fossil” manages to address some of the most pressing planetary concerns of our time while closely and charmingly exploring adolescence, tedium, the life of work, and what intimacy means in the face of looming disaster. I adored this story and these characters."

&mdash; Kali Fajardo-Anstine, author of Sabrina & Corina and Woman of Light
